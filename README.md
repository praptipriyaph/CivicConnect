# CivConnect
CivConnect is intended to serve as a transparent, efficient, and user-friendly communication channel between citizens and municipal authorities. It will enable users to report a variety of problems, such as damaged roads, sanitation issues, and public utility failures, and will provide a clear, trackable pathway to resolution. The system's core functionality is built around three main features: a public-facing issue submission and tracking interface, a GIS-integrated mapping system for precise location data, and a private dashboard for government officials to manage and respond to reports.
